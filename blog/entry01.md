i have chosen to work with the tool called kaboom because i figured its a good start to taking coding a game seriously but also a small challenge. I was going to make a game thats like fruit ninja but instead of fruits its bugs that when you click it says kaboom but i then decided to make a game instead where a sprite slowly flies up the middle of the screen and u have to click it as many times as u can and you get 3 tries and once your done with those 3 tries it rounds up an average for your clicks per second. Here is the link to kaboom  [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/setup) if you wanna try it for yourself. A tool i considered before kaboom was [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) just because it is also game related but me personally i found kaboom more interesting than phaser but also why do phaser when you got kaboom. Therefore this is why i am using kaboom, Some of the code snippets i used was ``<img src="image-url.jpg" alt="Description of the image">`` and using this code i was able to make a image for the game. Another code snippet i used for kaboom is ``<a href="https://example.com">come here</a>``, this is known as a hyper link and a hyper link can be used to guiding someone somewhere with a text saying something like "click here to go to ... (link)" if a user is lost. The process i went through to find the right tool for my game was pretty confusing because there were other options i had but i figured since i was gonna make a simple game i could use a simple tool that i knew nothing about untill i started to fidget with some kaboom code. Some of the skills i used was 1. Researching, without google or the internet none of code i used would have been possible to use because i wouldnt know what id be using it for. 2. time managemet, We had alot of time in class and i used most of the time looking at code snippets and tuts on kaboom games. 3. Interacting with others, I asked atleast 3 people for help and if i werent asking i would be lost on what i was doing.
