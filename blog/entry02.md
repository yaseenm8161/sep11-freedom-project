## Context
Through my journey learnign all about kaboom i can say i learned alot. A snippet i really enjoyed using and i know will be really useful to my future self is
``` js
const yaseen = ?
```
This code piece is declaring a variable meaning it is creating a storage for my variable to hold a certain value in one place. A video that helped my start an outline for a game would be this video [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZpbTR7pYR0). For every game you probably have seen a sprite, in other wordsa character being used to display as YOU or SOMETHING.
``` js
loadSprite("yaseen", "yaseen.png")
```
This line of code imports the sprite and the image the sprite is displaying. Looking at other examples of Kaboom showed me it didnt take that much time but the effort for example [kaboom game example](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=runner), you can see the code `loadSprite("bean", "/sprites/bean.png")` being used to make tha bean sprite which represents the player.

## EDP
I went through the process of researching, i had to go through youtube tutorials to website skimming to know what i know at the moment. Asking for help multiple times going to people around me for examples was helpful aswell


## Winter Break Goal
Get comfortable with my tool & be able to make a code off memory
