## Context
Through my journey learnign all about kaboom i can say i learned alot. A snippet i really enjoyed using and i know will be really useful to my future self is
``` js
const yaseen = ?
```
This code piece is declaring a variable meaning it is creating a storage for my variable to hold a certain value in one place. A video that helped my start an outline for a game would be this video [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZpbTR7pYR0). For every game you probably have seen a sprite, in other wordsa character being used to display as YOU or SOMETHING.
``` js
loadSprite("yaseen", "yaseen.png")
```
This line of code imports the sprite and the image the sprite is displaying. Looking at other examples of Kaboom showed me it didnt take that much time but the effort for example [kaboom game example](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=runner), you can see the code `loadSprite("bean", "/sprites/bean.png")` being used to make tha bean sprite which represents the player.

## EDP
I went through the process of researching, i had to go through youtube tutorials to website skimming to know what i know at the moment. Asking for help multiple times going to people around me for examples was helpful aswell.

## Challenges
some challenges i faced were code errors, most of my code wouldnt work even when i tried copy and pasting. I also had trouble finding code snippets that took cause in the games i was looking at for examples.

## Skills
Some of the skills i used was 1. Researching, without google or the internet none of code i used would have been possible to use because i wouldnt know what id be using it for 2. Interacting with others, I asked atleast 3 people for help and if i werent asking i would be lost on what i was doing.

## Winter Break Goal
I want to get more comfortable with my tool & be able to make a code off memory just so it can help my future self and maybe even make a game for myself.
