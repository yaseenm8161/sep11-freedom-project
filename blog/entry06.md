## Context
I FINALLY FINISHED MY MVP AKA WAPPA SMASHA AFTER ALL THE PROCRASTINATION USING [KABOOM](https://kaboomjs.com/)! but there were some challenges i sadly had to face because i needed to add a onkey press reset game button instead of having to press ctrl+r or go to the refresh button everytime you lose. Instead of going to detention i had to go to vierlings office to make up my work and the work i focused on mostly was this mvp. Everything was ready but the RESET ON KEY. i was lost so much very lose. I realized there were sources all around me, people who knew 10x what i knew and those are the people i asked. They told me to make another function which i forgot to make. After i have added this function my game was playable and i was technically done. Yes it was plain but i had to do it in no time to present for the expo.

```js
function mousePressed() {
  resetGame(); // this resets the game when the mouse is pressed
}
```
You can also do the same with keypressed like this
```js
function keyPressed() {
  resetGame(); // resets the game when a key is pressed
}
```

## Sources
Id very much hate to say i didnt use any sources but i used [GOOGLE](https://google.com). for a simple questions which was "how to reset game on click". My only other sources were my peers, ive done nothing but genuinley ask kindly and also ask mr mueller for help. Im surprised the internet bearly helped me out. Mr mueller helped me get my sprite error to stop and my game to finally load and a couple of peers helped me get my code to run in my preview


## EDP/ Engineering Design Process
I am finally on the last stage of the EDP which is communicating your results. I am pretty happy with where my project came up to because i underestimated my self heavily and didnt know i was capable of doing what i did. Therefore i will continue being in the last stage of EDP. Its only a matter of time i can see how far i can go and i will use time to my advantage.

## Skills

A skill i have learned is not procasinating, I realized how much i can get done without the procasination in less than half an hour since i usually procasinate for weeks for something i never knew i can do in 15 minutes because i havent tried. Another skill is communication, I hardly communicate with anyone but i now see that communication is a way of getting through life easier and better and this helped me with this MVP because without the communication i used to talk to my peers i doubt my product would have been existing.
