## Context
I have finished my project in time but i dont think its good enough to grab others attention to actually wanna interact with it due to the fact its simple and it didnt take much time to make because i was slacking alot during class. Meanwhile i believe what i have is enough to be fun for whoever plays it. I like it because i dont like bugs and i rather them all go extinct so thats what my game is made after. I used bugs everyone liked in movies and made it so you can click the bug to kill it. The hardest part was getting the sprite to load because i had the folder name different than the name im importing in my ide and thanks to mueller for pointing it out. for example
```js
loadSprite("bee", "/imgs/bean.png")
```
Whats wrong with this is my folder name was img and i told my ide to load the image in imgs so i gotta open my eyes more because the simplest mistake can cause the biggest problems.A problem i still have is the sprite size and i then figured it out. All i had to do was use
```js
scale(4)
```
 Like i said the easiest mistake can cause the worst problem. The more you know.
## Sources
I used alot of the website [KABOOM](https://kaboomjs.com/) because it was the tool i was using and it just makes sense to use a website that provides you with all your needs. I also used [YOUTUBE](https://youtube.com) watching tutorials and gameplays that inspired me to make a fun game that even i can play when im bored. Cant forget the main source which is my classmates and my teacher that helped me/ tried to help me and got me to accomplish my goals.


## EDP/ Engineering Design Process
I am currently in step 6 of Engineering Design process and i plan on staying in here while i get to the point where my project needs improving as a final product.

## Skills

The skills i have learned is to manage my time and i say its important because everything has its own place and time and for me i was not managing my time well and i was slacking and behind everyone. Then i started to lock in and manage my time and i did what i had to do and i regret not doing it earlier. Another skill "dont chase the points chase the learning"-Mr.Mueller. The more i learned the easier the points came to me.
